# This file is a YAML formatted file. YAML indenting is done in spaces not
# tabs, and whitespace is significant. If you don't stick to this, it will
# fail on provision

#
# IMPORTANT, if you change this file, you have to reprovision,  no exceptions
# vagrant reload --provision

# Utilities are system level items rather than sites, that install tools or packages
# the core utilities install tools such as phpmyadmin
utilities:
  core: # The core VVV utility
    - memcached-admin # Object cache management
    - opcache-status # opcache management
    - phpmyadmin # Web based database client
    - webgrind # PHP Debugging
    - trusted-hosts # GitHub etc
    - tls-ca # SSL
    - php56
    #- php70
    - php71
    #- php72

# vm_config controls how Vagrant provisions the virtual machine, and can be used to
# increase the memory given to VVV and the number of CPU cores. For WP core development
# we recommend at least 2GB ( 2048 )
# It can also be used to override the default provider being used within Vagrant.
# Due to a limitation within Vagrant, the specified provider is only respected on a clean `vagrant up`
# as Vagrant currently restricts you to one provider per machine
# https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/basic_usage.html#vagrant-up
vm_config:
  memory: 2048
  cores: 2
  # provider: vmware_workstation
